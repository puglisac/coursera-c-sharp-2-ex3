# Exercise 2: Lists

This is an exercise for the coursera course [More C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/more-programming-unity)

### Getting Started

Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the ConsoleCards link in the pane on the left; this is the documentation for the classes I provided to you in the ConsoleCards dll.

Open the Exercise2 solution in your IDE.

### Problem 1 - Convert from an array to a list

Change the code in the \tt{Main}Main method to use a list of cards instead of an array.

Remember, the **List** class is in the **System.Collections.Generic** namespace, so you may need to add a using directive for that namespace.
