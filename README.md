# Exercise 2: Lists

This is an exercise for the coursera course [More C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/more-programming-unity)



### Problem 1 - Populate and print the list

Use a for loop to populate the list with the integers from 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10).

Use a for loop to print the contents of the list. As the For Loops lecture discussed, the **List** class has a **Count** property that tells how many elements the list contains. You should use that property as appropriate in your for loop condition rather than hard-coding how many times the loop body will execute.

### Problem 2 - Use a for loop to remove even numbers from the list

Use a backward for loop, starting at the last index in the list, to remove the even numbers from the list.

Use a for loop to print the contents of the list.

Note: By ugly coincidence, this would also work with a forward for loop because the elements that "escape processing" would all be odd numbers.

### Problem 3 - Observe bad forward for loop removal

Populate a list with the numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive. Use a forward for loop (starting i at 0) to remove 1, 2, and 3 from the list.

Print the list to see that 2 gets skipped over, staying in the list.
